# Smart Contract Development Timeline

## Project Timeline Breakdown

### Part 1: Contract Development
- **Duration:** 8-12 Days (Buffer and Contract Changes Included)
- **Description:** Initial smart contract development, including implementation of core functionality, security considerations, and revisions based on stakeholder feedback.

### Part 2: Contract Testing
- **Duration:** 3-6 Days
- **Description:** Comprehensive unit testing, function verification, and fuzzy testing to identify edge cases and ensure contract stability.

### Part 3: TypeScript SDK Development
- **Duration:** 2-4 Days
- **Description:** Building a full-fledged TypeScript SDK for seamless contract integration.

### Part 4: Documentation
- **Duration:** 1-2 Days
- **Description:** Creating detailed documentation for all contract functions and SDK usage.

### Extras: Shell Scripts
- **Duration:** 3-4 Days
- **Description:** Development of shell scripts for direct contract testing and control via command line.

## Overall Timeline

| Phase | Component | Minimum Duration | Maximum Duration |
|-------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| **1** | Contract Development | 8 days | 12 days |
| **2** | Contract Testing | 3 days | 6 days |
| **3** | TypeScript SDK | 2 days | 4 days |
| **4** | Documentation | 1 day | 2 days |
| **Extra** | Shell Scripts | 3 days | 4 days |
| **Total** | **Full Project** | **17 days** | **28 days** |

## Critical Path Analysis

Assuming best-case scenario (minimum duration):
- Project can be completed in **17 days** (~3.5 weeks)

Assuming worst-case scenario (maximum duration):
- Project can be completed in **28 days** (~5.5 weeks)

## Milestone Checkpoints

| Milestone | Expected Completion | Deliverables |
